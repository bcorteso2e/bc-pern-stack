## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

## 🚧 Development Mode

> Uses [`concurrently`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run both backend and frontend in a single container with hot reload support.

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix client
```

▶️ Run in Development
docker-compose up --build

🚀 Production Mode
Uses docker-compose.prod.yml, builds the frontend and serves it as static files via Express.

📦 Build and Deploy

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build

📂 Notes
node_modules folders are excluded from host to prevent conflicts with Docker volumes:
volumes:
  - .:/app
  - /app/node_modules
  - /app/client/node_modules



Make sure your .env file includes all necessary environment variables (e.g. for PostgreSQL connection).
